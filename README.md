🕵️‍♂️ Individual Role: Digital Incident Investigation – CST2580

Project Title: Digital Incident Scene Investigation & Analysis
Module: CST2580 – Digital Forensics & Investigations
Team Members: Haider, Aloyce, Diren, Byron
Institution: Middlesex University London
Date: April 2024

🔍 My Role: Digital Forensics Investigator
As part of a four-person digital forensic team, I was responsible for the interrogation, evidence acquisition, system log analysis, and event reconstruction during a simulated cybercrime investigation involving a data breach at the virtual company M57.biz.

🧩 Core Responsibilities
🗣️ 1. Interrogation and Suspect Interviews

Led the interview and behavioral analysis of two primary suspects, Jean and Allison.
Developed and asked 14 strategically formulated questions to evaluate inconsistencies in suspect statements.
Identified deception cues and contradictions, which were later correlated with technical evidence.
Delivered a detailed interview analysis report highlighting suspicious behavior and verbal inconsistencies.
🧾 2. Evidence Collection & Scene Documentation

Secured the digital crime scene alongside the team; ensured no evidence tampering.
Collected and documented digital evidence including:
Email credentials found on paper notes
Devices and hardware (e.g., hard drives)
Ensured evidence integrity using chain of custody protocols and evidence bagging techniques.
Photographed the digital crime scene and maintained location integrity throughout.
🔍 3. System Log & Timeline Analysis

Participated in the forensic analysis of Jean’s system using Autopsy and FTK Imager.
Investigated:
User account activity and login timestamps
Connected devices (USB history)
Browser history, downloads, and cookies
Event logs tied to file access, deletion, and network activity
Identified malicious behavior patterns (e.g., usage of spoofed email addresses, installation of suspicious programs like VMware Tools).
📈 4. Reconstruction of the Digital Incident

Analyzed .pst email files using GoldFynch to trace how confidential spreadsheets were leaked.
Traced spoofed email headers and evaluated email misconfiguration vulnerabilities.
Reconstructed a full timeline of the breach, including how Jean sent confidential data to a spoofed address due to social engineering and email display name spoofing.
🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
Forensic Tools: Autopsy 4.21, FTK Imager 3.2, GoldFynch
Investigation Techniques: Structured interrogation, evidence handling, log correlation, metadata analysis
Protocols Followed: ISO/IEC 27037, ISO/IEC 27042, SWGDE best practices
📚 Learning Outcomes
Applied real-world digital forensic methodologies under academic supervision.
Developed experience in cross-referencing human behavior with system logs.
Strengthened skills in timeline analysis, email header inspection, and user activity profiling.
Understood the critical impact of human error, email spoofing, and security misconfigurations on data breaches.
